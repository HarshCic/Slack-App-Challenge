# Slack App Challenge

In this challenge you have to build any slack app for Google India Scholars 2018 slack workspace. **The best will get integrated in the workspace so that students can benefit from it** and who knows there may be **surprises** too:wink:. Your app will be also listed here. You may need some permission from workspace's owner. You can always reach to Akshit sir(@akshit.udacity) for that. You can also discuss idea in **#slack_help** channel. After completing you have to fill the Google form which I have attached in #slack_help's topic. Can't wait to see what you're gonna build. :computer: :fire: :boom:

Here are some resources you can check.
